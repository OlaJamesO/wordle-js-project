# Word Masters

Welcome to the Word Masters game, a captivating and challenging word puzzle inspired by the popular word-guessing games. This project was developed as a part of a Frontend Masters workshop to hone skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on interactive web development.

### Features

- Dynamic word generation from an external API.
- Real-time feedback on guesses, indicating correct, close, or incorrect letters.
- Visual and textual cues to help guide the player through the game process.
- A sleek, responsive design that adapts to various device screens.
